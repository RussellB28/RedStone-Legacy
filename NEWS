          3.0

The future of IRC bots is here! Ethrik gives to you, Auto 3.0, a new version of
the popular Auto IRC bot.

In this alpha12 release, we have added:

* IPLookup: Lookup information on an IP address
* contact_home: Collect stats on version/operating systems Auto is ran on. In the future this will be expanded upon.
* API: allow hooking to any and every possible command via rchook.
* Pisg: Added a module to automate Pisg and log with a recognized format.
* API::Socket - Exposing sockets to the API allowing custom sockets/parsers in modules.
* BotStats: Changed command to match module name and added support for API::Socket.
* Sandboxing Eval and Modules
* QDB: Majority rewrite. New features. See module for details.
* OnJoin: Added a configurable HelloChan replacement.
* Replay: Added a module to replay channel history.
* Twitter: A twitter feed announcer.
* QDB: Massive rewrite
* Factoids: Added INFO command.
* ABStats: Additonal bot statistics.
* Pisg 1.01: Recheck certain things when rehashed.
* NickPrefix: Extends fantasy support to allow for command execution when the bot is addressed.
* DNS: A module for resolution of DNS hostnames.
* Seen: A seen module, adds the SEEN command.
* LinkTitle 3.00: Fixes all known bugs in LinkTitle and adds YouTube title support.
* Added IPv6 SSL support.
* Made bind optional in server blocks.

Bug fixes:

* var/ permissions error on first run.
* If -c was passed at runtime, also pass it upon restart.
* LinkTitle: Remove trailing/leading spaces and ignore if a title is empty.
* Rehash: fixed a crash bug when trying to load a module in config that's not already loaded.
* contact_home: Fixed bug when check-in server is unresponsive.
* match_user/has_priv: Fixed a bug where only one block can be matched even if a user fits into multiple. This could cause you not to get some privileges.
* module loading: Fixed a bug where mod_load would say a module loaded fine when it really didn't.
* Fixed a bug in API::Socket that'd cause the function to not return upon an error.

Incompatibilities:

* SSL on InspIRCd doesn't appear to be working correctly for some. Looking into this.

We thank you for choosing Auto. Please remember that he is coming to late
development stages soon, and testers are needed! But we hope we've piqued
your interest, as Auto's upcoming module repository will allow modules to be
created by anyone and uploaded there for everyone to use.

Auto's goal is to create an efficient, stable and highly customizable IRC bot
in Perl. To offer an alternative to other platforms.

Enjoy Auto 3.0.0 Alpha 12!
