RedStone 1.0: Microsoft Windows Notes
===============================================================================

When running RedStone on Microsoft Windows, you should be aware of the following:

* Windows support has not been thoroughly tested, some scripts/features/modules may not
  function correctly.
* Forking into the background is disabled.
* Some file system operations may fail if RedStone is installed to a path with
  spaces. Please report these.

For the full power of RedStone; run him in a UNIX environment.

Since Windows support can be considered experimental, testers are welcome and
you should report anything you find to malfunction.

At some point in the future, we hope to achieve Windows support with no core
caveats. Again, reporting issues in RedStone on Windows is highly appreciated.
